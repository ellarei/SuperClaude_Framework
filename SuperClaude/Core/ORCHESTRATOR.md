# ORCHESTRATOR.md - SuperClaude Intelligent Routing System

Intelligent routing system for Claude Code SuperClaude framework.

## 🧠 Detection Engine

Analyzes requests to understand intent, complexity, and requirements.

### Pre-Operation Validation Checks

**Resource Validation**:
- Token usage prediction based on operation complexity and scope
- Memory and processing requirements estimation
- File system permissions and available space verification
- MCP server availability and response time checks

**Compatibility Validation**:
- Flag combination conflict detection (e.g., `--no-mcp` with `--seq`)
- Persona + command compatibility verification
- Tool availability for requested operations
- Project structure requirements validation

**Risk Assessment**:
- Operation complexity scoring (0.0-1.0 scale)
- Failure probability based on historical patterns
- Resource exhaustion likelihood prediction
- Cascading failure potential analysis

**Validation Logic**: Resource availability, flag compatibility, risk assessment, outcome prediction, and safety recommendations. Operations with risk scores >0.8 trigger safe mode suggestions.

**Resource Management Thresholds**:
- **Green Zone** (0-60%): Full operations, predictive monitoring active
- **Yellow Zone** (60-75%): Resource optimization, caching, suggest --uc mode
- **Orange Zone** (75-85%): Warning alerts, defer non-critical operations  
- **Red Zone** (85-95%): Force efficiency modes, block resource-intensive operations
- **Critical Zone** (95%+): Emergency protocols, essential operations only

### Pattern Recognition Rules

### Intent Extraction Algorithm
```
1. Parse user request for keywords and patterns
2. Match against domain/operation matrices
3. Score complexity based on scope and steps
4. Evaluate wave opportunity scoring
5. Estimate resource requirements
6. Generate routing recommendation (traditional vs wave mode)
7. Apply auto-detection triggers for wave activation
```

**Enhanced Wave Detection Algorithm**:
- **Flag Overrides**: `--single-wave` disables, `--force-waves`/`--wave-mode` enables
- **Scoring Factors**: Complexity (0.2-0.4), scale (0.2-0.3), operations (0.2), domains (0.1), flag modifiers (0.05-0.1)
- **Thresholds**: Default 0.7, customizable via `--wave-threshold`, enterprise strategy lowers file thresholds
- **Decision Logic**: Sum all indicators, trigger waves when total ≥ threshold

2. Explicit flags > auto-activation
3. Advanced reasoning depth: --tot + --mad + --sc > individual reasoning flags > standard analysis
4. Thinking depth: --ultrathink > --think-hard > --think
5. --no-mcp overrides all individual MCP flags
6. Scope: system > project > module > file
7. Last specified persona takes precedence (unless --mad overrides for debate)
8. Wave mode: --wave-mode off > --wave-mode force > --wave-mode auto
9. Sub-Agent delegation: explicit --delegate > auto-detection
10. Loop mode: explicit --loop > auto-detection based on refinement keywords
11. --uc auto-activation overrides verbose flags (except for reasoning transparency)

## 🚨 Emergency Protocols

Handling resource constraints and failures gracefully.

### Resource Management
Threshold-based resource management follows the unified Resource Management Thresholds (see Detection Engine section above).

### Graceful Degradation
- **Level 1**: Reduce verbosity, skip optional enhancements, use cached results
- **Level 2**: Disable advanced features, simplify operations, batch aggressively
- **Level 3**: Essential operations only, maximum compression, queue non-critical

### Error Recovery Patterns
- **MCP Timeout**: Use fallback server
- **Token Limit**: Activate compression
- **Tool Failure**: Try alternative tool
- **Parse Error**: Request clarification
